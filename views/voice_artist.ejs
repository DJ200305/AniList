          Eren is Shingeki no Kyojin's protagonist. His foster sister, Mikasa,
          notes on numerous occasions that he acts on impulse without thinking
          things through, and she often pulls/carries/throws him when he starts
          fighting with others to protect him from himself. Along with Mikasa,
          he tends to spend his free time with their mutual friend, Armin. His
          father is a doctor (who is well respected by Hannes and potentially
          many more) whilst his mother is a housewife. When Eren was a child, he
          saved Mikasa from being sold off when he visited her home with his
          father. Three men—killers of her parents—were in her house, and he
          killed two of them—one by slitting his throat and the other by
          charging at with a quickly assembled spear. Mikasa herself killed the
          third man after Eren urged her to fight whilst the man strangled Eren.
          After this, he gave Mikasa his scarf and Eren's father adopted Mikasa
          into their family. Later, when the colossal titan broke through Wall
          Maria the debris from this attack scattered and hurtled towards his
          home. He could only watch on as his mother—trapped under the rubble of
          their house—was eaten by a titan. This event lit the fire of revenge
          within Eren that he would kill every giant and not live a life
          cowering in fear. Sometime after this—before the time skip that jumped
          a few years ahead, to when he became a soldier—his father injected him
          with something. It's unknown what at this time but it turns out,
          because of the injection, Eren can utilize the ability to transform
          into a titan himself (which explains how his limbs were able to
          regenerate) with side effects of high fever and massive stamina drain.
          It is later revealed that Eren has both the Attack Titan and the
          Founding Titan. Eren later inherits the Warhammer Titan as well. At
          the end of the series, Eren is killed by Mikasa.
